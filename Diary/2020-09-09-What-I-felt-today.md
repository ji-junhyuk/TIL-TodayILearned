# Can your successes and failures and the choices that make them connect?

You have to make wise choices in context with great direction and strong values. 

If those actions pile up and pile up, your competitors will imitate you, but you won't be able to catch up. 

You will be able to differentiate yourself and get some of the value you create. 

However, if your actions are inconsistent and just swung back and forth depending on the situation, you won't be able to differentiate.

Customers won't even pay you. We must prioritize rather than try to seize every opportunity we encounter. 

We must reject opportunities we can't seize and seize the opportunities that suit us. In order to move forward, we have to pay attention to the connection between the choices without looking at them separately.

# Q1. Why am I doing this?
Because I said I would try it for a month.

# Q2. What did you fell while doing this today
I will tell you what I have done first.
I got this job today. [autumobile repair shop] [informative text] [no topic] [20]
while requesting an informational article from a maintenance shop, he described his work as an attached document.
There was a guideline not to write seasonal articles when writing without giving a subject. It was very Nasty.
It was difficult to write an informational article based on what this company doing.
After a few hours, I got angry. 
The thought of "Write an informational article like this?, yes, please write it my own way"covered my head. 
There is one fact that I realized today. It doesn't matter if it takes 10 minutes and 20 minutes to write an article.
I have to see when I started and when I ended. I started at 5:30 a.m. and it ended at 5:30 p.m. 
Excluding the time to eat lunch and take a walk with Genie, it is about 10 hours working, and it is 3,000 won per hour. 
Angry. In fact, I want to beatit right now.

# Q3. Then why didn't you say you were quitting today?
I wanted to keep it because I said it was for a month. Instead, I asked if I could write 10 articles a day, but I got a reply saying that it shouldn't be done if I do not add additional photos.

# Q4. What is the future direction?
Either way, I'll try to find a direction for a month. 
It takes at least 5hours and an hourly wage of 6000won is the limit of this work, but it will do it.
My minimum cost of living is because I have to earn.
And self-development while working starts now. 
I have to split my time and develop myself. 
It starts with need.
